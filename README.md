# Landing Page Model with flex and grid responsive section

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out! 
You are more than welcome to give feedbacks, propose changes and give contructive ideas to my code!

## My process

I used some grid and flex proprierties to assemble the landing page properly. 
Separate it in sections and kept bigger issued subjects to highlight each one of them. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox properties
- CSS Grid 

### Useful resources

- https://fontawesome.com/ - This helped me to choose icons and transform them in fonts. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
